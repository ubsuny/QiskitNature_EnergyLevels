# QiskitNature_EnergyLevels
## Description
+ This is a midterm project for computational physics 1. In this project, I will **use Qiskit nature to study electronic structure and calculate ground state**.

+ There are three main parts in the project: **Literature**, **implementation** and **presentation**. The jupyter notebooks for literature and implementation part can be found in the corresponding folder. The presentation part includes this README file and a **[YouTube-style video]()**.

+ Note that **this project is mainly based on tutorials from [Qiskit Nature Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/index.html)**. The References can be found at the corresponding jupyter notebook and the license can be found in the main folder.

## Literature

### I. Introduction

As a new topic in the course of computaional physics this semester, quantum computer provides novel and fantastic ways for us to study and solve problems that we used to solve in classical way and surely shows the possibility that we could use it to solve complicate problems more effectively. One simple example we have seen is the half adder circuit that can calculate 1+1=2 by **IBM Qiskit**, but could **we extend our vision to more complex problem that also related to the physics**? The answer is definitely yes. The amazing platform that we will use in this midterm project is the **Qiskit Nature**, which is designed to bridge the gap between natural sciences and quantum simulations. For this midterm project, **we will only focus on the simple part of solution-driven ones by applying them to study the physical problem of energy level and trying to understand and rewrite the codes from given examples.**

Then let me briefly talk about the **physical context of this midterm project:** As we know for classical particles, they can have any amount of energy or the so-called "continuous energy" and can be solved by using Lagrangian mechanics or Hamiltonian mechanics from the classical theory. As a contrast, things become different when we dive in the micorscopic world of quantum mechanics since particles in quantum system are bound or spatially confined, which means they can only take on certain discrete values of energy and they are called **energy levels** as shown on the picture below. The energy spectrum of a system with such discrete energy levels is said to be **quantized** and such terms are commonly used for the energy levels of the electrons in atoms, ions, or molecules, which are bound by the electric field of the nucleus[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level).
